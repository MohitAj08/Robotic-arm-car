# Robotic-arm-car
Codes for robotic car

This is a project dedicated to developing an easy way of teaching robotics to kids by using existing models and 3d printing to create a robot.
The microcontroller used is an Arduino Mega with a custom made pcb consisting of 3 A4988 Stepper motor drivers and a few pins and sockets.
Programming complexity will be kept on the lower side, as we just want to create a robot that can do simple movements according to live inputs from a user of a mobile app.
